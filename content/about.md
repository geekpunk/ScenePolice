![scene police](/images/original-logo.jpg "scene police")

German & UK hardcore/ punk label, formed in 1998 and closed its doors in 2003 with 40 releases under its belt. As the old Toten Hosen song depicts, “It started six years ago, it was like a revolution, goal and direction unknown, the old was burned down - we will go down with flags flying.”

Owned and operated by DPM and the Metal Angel; co-Founded & Operated by the Goit as the UK side of the label up until 2001, the label started out of the remnants of Revolution Inside (Guts Pie Earshot, Fluid To Gas, Drunk, Impact, Craving etc.) with music that was either too emo, pop-punky or noisy for the latter. Beginnings of the label can also be traced back to the HC & Punk Fanzine INTERPOL TIMES, published 1991 – 1999, also run by DPM and the Goit.

Scene Police was basically started with the premise to put out and support music of befriended bands, bands that the owners liked and to support political organizations.

Over time, the label grew in size and in personnel, all of whom put in their own time and work into it, and had their say in each release. A large collective of equal minded people that grew to the size of a ginormous hangover.

Distribution was handled by Stickfigure in the US and Flight 13 in Europe with trades going on internationally.

Scene Police's first release in years [will be Ligatures A23a](/post/ligatures-release/) in the summer of 2024.
