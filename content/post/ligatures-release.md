Old punks who stick around grow up either make mature music that normal people like or continue playing the songs they wrote as teens to much bigger crowds. Or, in the case of D.C.’s Ligatures, they channel the same original instincts into a new take on the loud, fast, artsy template. Born from ex-members of (forgotten) Pittsburgh 1990s hardcore outfits Pressgang and Crucial Unit, Ligatures blends classic D.C. hardcore aggression, Chicago noise rock rhythmic dissonance, UK post-punk experimental dinginess, and outsider garage rock. Lyrics bring a less certain, less secure take on a world that’s become more fragmented and insane since the band were young enough to think they had it all figured out. In 2023 Ligatures played their first shows in DC and Baltimore, blowing fuses and breaking equipment with disturbing frequency. 

They recently recorded their debut LP to be released in the summer of 2024 titled A23a, named after the world's largest iceberg which recently separated from Antarctica.  The record was recorded at Takoma Park MD, with Dan Godwin right after the latest Mastethitics record.  

We're excited to release their debut LP this summer.
